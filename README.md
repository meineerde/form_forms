# FormForms

Configurable forms for Rails 3, based on the excellent [simple_form](https://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form).

The goal is to provide forms (as in views) which are flexible enough to
fullfill their intended usage but be able to be configured by plugins. Thus
plugins can easily add, delete and edit form fields without having to override
whole views which are hard to patch.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'form_forms'

And then execute:

    bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    gem install form_forms
